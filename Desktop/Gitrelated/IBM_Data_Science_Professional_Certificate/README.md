## About Course and Certificate
Prepare for a career in the high-growth field of data science. In this program, I developed the skills, tools, and portfolio to have a competitive edge in the job market as an entry-level data scientist. No prior knowledge of computer science or programming languages is required. 

Data science involves **gathering, cleaning, organizing, and analyzing data with the goal of extracting helpful insights and predicting expected outcomes**. The demand for skilled data scientists who can use data to tell compelling stories to inform business decisions has never been greater.

I learned in-demand skills used by professional data scientists, including **databases, data visualization, statistical analysis, predictive modeling, machine learning algorithms,** and **data mining**. I also worked with the latest languages, tools, and libraries, including **Python, SQL, Jupyter notebooks, Github, Rstudio, Pandas, Numpy, ScikitLearn, Matplotlib,** and more. Upon completing the full program, I had built a portfolio of data science projects. This Professional Certificate had a strong emphasis on applied learning and included a series of hands-on labs in the IBM Cloud that gave me practical skills.
